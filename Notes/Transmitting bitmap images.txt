Transmitting bitmap images


Bitmap files

A common way of storing digital images is by storing a colour represented in binary for each pixel, one after another.
Metadata, such as the width and height of the image in pixels, is also stored and is used to arrange the pixels correctly.

Bitmaps map data to bits and map pixels to bits, the number of bits used to represent colour is called the colour depth,
modern ones tend to use 24 to 32 bits, and they use the rgb colour system (red, green, blue).

Each value used 8 bits that represent transparency and 255 being opaque, red is (225,0,0), blue is (0,0,255)
while is all 255 and black is all 0

Other file formats

Images are very rarely stored in bitmap format, because they would be too large. The image above image had four bytes
for every pixel; with 2,073,600 pixels, it would take 66,355,200 bits or ~8MB of data for just one image.

To keep the size down, most images are stored in a compressed format, and these will be the formats you are used to.

.PNG is a bitmap image format stored using lossless compression; it uses patterns in pixel colour to reduce the amount
of data that is stored. The .JPG format uses a lossy compression scheme, getting rid of colour data that the human eye
would not pick up.

If bits are lost in these formats, large areas of the image may be affected. If you want to send them over an unreliable
 transmission, error detection and correction methods are needed.
