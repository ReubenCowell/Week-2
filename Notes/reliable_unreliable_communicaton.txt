There are two types of connection, reliable and unreliable.

A reliable connection is one that ensures data is transmitted/received correctly
and the data is correct when it is received. it is used when the data that is
received needs to be correct for things like email, file transfers or instant
messaging. However, making it so reliable means that it is a lot less efficient.
The TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is an example of a reliable method, but
it adds 42-63 extra bytes along with the message and the receiving device has
to send back data too.

Unreliable communication systems are more efficient because they send less data.
They don't set up connections or check if the data was received or if it was in
the right order. It may be used when minor data loss would not prevent an
application from working. Examples may include music or video streaming, gaming,
continuous transmission of sensor data, broadcasting data and video/voice
calling.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a widely used unreliable protocol. UDP adds only
a small amount of data compared to TCP and is therefore faster and more
efficient, if the communication can cope with a potential loss of data, or with
the data arriving out of order.

UDP does not stream data like TCP does, each message is, instead, its own
Datagram (single packet or message), if the message is received, it will be
completed.

Complex programs can use a mix of reliable and unreliable data to communicate.
